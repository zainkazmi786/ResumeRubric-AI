    You are a highly precise assistant. Your task is to extract a detailed hiring rubric from the following faculty advertisement text.

    You must strictly output a **valid JSON object** with the following structure and rules:

    üîπ Top-level keys = Exact Job Titles as written (e.g., "Assistant Professor - School of Computing Sciences")

    üîπ For each job title, include:

    - "must_have": [
    A list of mandatory qualifications. Use structured phrases like:
    - "Degree: PhD or MS (First Division, 18 years of education) from an HEC recognized Institution"
    - "Field of study must be one of: Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Cyber Security"
    ]

    - "optional": [
    A list of preferred (but not mandatory) qualifications, degrees, certifications, or fields.
    Prefix these with "Preferred:" or "Recommended:" to make it explicit.
    ]

    - "experience": [
    Specific teaching or industry experience, e.g.,
    - "3 years university teaching experience in relevant field"
    - "5 years professional R&D experience"
    ]

    - "notes": [
    Any extra conditions such as:
    - "Age limit: 40 years"
    - "PEC registration required"
    - "HEC recognized degree mandatory"
    - "No 3rd Division allowed in academic record"
    ]

    üìå Extraction Instructions:

    - Map degree names precisely. Capture combinations like "PhD or First Division MS" accurately.
    - List all specializations as written. Do not shorten field names (e.g., use "Robotics and Automation" not just "Robotics").
    - If both Assistant Professor and Lecturer are grouped, split into two separate keys using job titles as written.
    - If teaching/research experience is stated as an alternative depending on degree level, list both in the "experience" array.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è OUTPUT FORMAT:

    - Return only a valid JSON object.
